## Explorations of Parse Hub's Ability to Pick Data 
[The Racial Profiling Search Results](https://www.aclu.org/search/%20?f[0]=field_issues:245)

## All 667 Records on Racial Profiling are Organized into Downloadable Excel Workbook
#### Organization of the Fields: Title, URL, Publication Date, and the Media Type (out of nine possible)

With three sheets: One organized by Date of Publication: the Second by The Nine Media Types in Assenting Order: the Third is For You to Sort However You Would

If a search result interests you and/or you would like to explore the different Media Types, Click on the URL of that record, you will be able to copy it.

_Here I used ZenHub, a New Issue, dragged and droped the file into the Issue, waited for ZenHub to convert the input, copied the output and pasted it just above to create this downloadable link_
